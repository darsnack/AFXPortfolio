\subsection{Description}
This mono effect combines a track with one or more delayed copies. There is a separate gain control for the dry copy and each of the delayed copies. The delay block accepts fractional delays from a local oscillator (usually at a frequency of 0.1 Hz) where each delayed copy has an LO at a different phase. As a result, the listener will perceive multiple voices or instruments playing together (like a chorus).

\subsection{Applications}
The chorus effect is an easy way to add depth to a track. In particular, it is an artificial method to simulate double-tracking, a common technique used by artists to create a ``fuller'' sound.
